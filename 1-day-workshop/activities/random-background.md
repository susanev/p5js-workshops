# Random background color
_Activity 1_

## Goal
With every click by the user the background of the sketch should change color.

## Functions to consider using
* `canvasSize`
* `background`
* `mousePressed` (you may also consider exploring with the variable `mouseIsPressed`)
* `random`

## Digital color
There are many different ways to represent color on a computer. For now, we are going to focus on representing color with RGB values. That's red, green, and blue light. You provide a value that represents the amount of red, the amount of green, and the amount of blue. The minimum value is 0, and the maximum value is 255. If you provide 0 for red, green, and blue that will be black, as if no light is turned on at all for any of the colors. If you turn on the maximum value for all three colors (255), that will make white.

## Discussion questions
* If red is 255, green is 0, and blue is 0 what color will be created?
* If red is 255, green is 255, and blue is 0 what color will be created?
* If red is 15, blue is 15, and green is 15 what color will be created?
* If red, blue, and green are all the same value you know it will either be black, white, or a shade of what?

## Extra Challenge
Before working on this extra challenge talk to your volunteer about:
  * The differences between assignment and equality
  * Something that you tried that _didn't_ work and how you eventually fixed it

Change your program to only change color after 2 clicks from the user (instead of 1).
